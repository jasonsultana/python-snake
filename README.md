# python-snake
Source code for a snake game made with Python and Pygame

I made this for fun over a weekend or so, since:

a) While I haven't spent a huge amount of time with Python myself (and didn't have much of a reason to), I've noticed that it's become quite popular among
students that I coach, so I wanted to become more familiar with it.

b) I'd never made Snake before!

I'm hoping that this codebase and the corresponding notes on Youtube are helpful to someone.
